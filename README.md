# Fault_Current_Calculator

Import Z-Bus calculations from excel

Import line impedance characteristics from excel

Import GISView line trace from excel

Get user inputs for Voltage Base, MVA Base, TR size, TR impedance percentage, TR config (Delta-wye, wye-wye, etc....)

Calculate impedances and fault current based on fault location and type of transformer

Output to shell, (UI to be developed after this is working)
